  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public

software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software

using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
d29f d7a2d455d 3f6b

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
9273320805 9656d7 56 be2 cc8d5cd
9 73 20 057 656d70 6bb

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether

you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and

that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
cc15 c14 704073f8d5 6d 794c c686 cc15 c149 0407 f8 5d6 979 ccc686
cc 59
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free

program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed

refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:

distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any

    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
